Feature: Single Node operations on multiple workspaces/content streams; e.g. copy on write!

  Background:
    Given I have no content dimensions
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:

  Scenario: Set property of a node
    Given the command "SetNodeProperties" is executed with payload:
      | Key                       | Value                |
      | contentStreamIdentifier   | "user-cs-identifier" |
      | nodeAggregateIdentifier   | "nody-mc-nodeface"   |
      | originDimensionSpacePoint | {}                   |
      | propertyValues            | {"text": "Changed"}  |
      | initiatingUserIdentifier      | "initiating-user-identifier" |

    Then I expect exactly 2 events to be published on stream with prefix "Neos.ContentRepository:ContentStream:user-cs-identifier"
    And event at index 1 is of type "Neos.EventSourcedContentRepository:NodePropertiesWereSet" with payload:
      | Key                       | Expected             |
      | contentStreamIdentifier   | "user-cs-identifier" |
      | nodeAggregateIdentifier   | "nody-mc-nodeface"   |
      | originDimensionSpacePoint | []                   |
      | propertyValues.text.value | "Changed"            |
      | initiatingUserIdentifier      | "initiating-user-identifier" |

    When the graph projection is fully up to date
    And I am in the active content stream of workspace "live" and Dimension Space Point {}
    Then I expect a node identified by aggregate identifier "nody-mc-nodeface" to exist in the subgraph
    And I expect this node to have the properties:
      | Key  | Value    |
      | text | Original |

    When I am in the active content stream of workspace "user-test" and Dimension Space Point {}
    Then I expect a node identified by aggregate identifier "nody-mc-nodeface" to exist in the subgraph
    And I expect this node to have the properties:
      | Key  | Value   |
      | text | Changed |

    When I am in the active content stream of workspace "live" and Dimension Space Point {}
    Then I expect node aggregate identifier "nodingers-cat" and path "child/pet" to lead to node {"contentStreamIdentifier": "cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier": "nodingers-cat", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}}
    When I go to the parent node of node aggregate "nodingers-cat"
    Then I expect the current Node to have the properties:
      | Key  | Value    |
      | text | Original |

    When I am in the active content stream of workspace "user-test" and Dimension Space Point {}
    Then I expect node aggregate identifier "nodingers-cat" and path "child/pet" to lead to node {"contentStreamIdentifier": "user-cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier": "nodingers-cat", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}}
    When I go to the parent node of node aggregate "nodingers-cat"
    Then I expect the current Node to have the properties:
      | Key  | Value   |
      | text | Changed |
