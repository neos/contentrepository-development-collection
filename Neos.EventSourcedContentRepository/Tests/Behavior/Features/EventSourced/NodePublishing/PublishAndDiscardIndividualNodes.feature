Feature: Publishing and discard individual nodes (basics)

  Publishing an individual node works
  Node structure is as follows:
  - rn-identifier (root node)
  -- sir-david-nodenborough (name=text1) <== modifications!
  --- nody-mc-nodeface (name=text2) <== modifications!
  -- sir-nodeward-nodington-iii (name=image) <== modifications!


  Background:
    Given I have no content dimensions
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                        | Value           |

      | newContentStreamIdentifier | "cs-identifier" |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    Neos.ContentRepository:Root: {}
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Content':
      properties:

    # discard "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii"
    When the command DiscardIndividualNodesFromWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key           | Value                                                                                                                                   |
      | workspaceName | "user-test"                                                                                                                             |
      | nodeAddresses | [{"contentStreamIdentifier": "user-cs-identifier", "dimensionSpacePoint": {}, "nodeAggregateIdentifier": "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii"}] |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date

    # live WS does not change because of a discard
    When I am in the active content stream of workspace "live" and Dimension Space Point {}
    Then I expect the Node Aggregate "sir-david-nodenborough" to have the properties:
      | Key  | Value      |
      | text | Initial t1 |
    And I expect the Node Aggregate "nody-mc-nodeface" to have the properties:
      | Key  | Value      |
      | text | Initial t2 |
    And I expect the Node Aggregate "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii" to have the properties:
      | Key   | Value         |
      | image | Initial image |
