Feature: Disable a node aggregate

  As a user of the CR I want to disable a node aggregate and expect its descendants to also be disabled.

  These are the test cases without dimensions being involved

  Background:
    Given I have no content dimensions
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': []
    """
    And the event RootWorkspaceWasCreated was published with payload:

  Scenario: Disable node with arbitrary strategy since dimensions are not involved
    When the command DisableNodeAggregate is executed with payload:

      | nodeVariantSelectionStrategy | "allVariants"            |

    Then I expect exactly 8 events to be published on stream with prefix "Neos.ContentRepository:ContentStream:cs-identifier"
    And event at index 7 is of type "Neos.EventSourcedContentRepository:NodeAggregateWasDisabled" with payload:
      | Key                          | Expected                 |

      | initiatingUserIdentifier     | "initiating-user-identifier" |

    When the graph projection is fully up to date
    And I am in content stream "cs-identifier"
    Then I expect the graph projection to consist of exactly 5 nodes
    And I expect a node with identifier {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"lady-eleonode-rootford", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}} to exist in the content graph
    And I expect a node with identifier {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"preceding-nodenborough", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}} to exist in the content graph

    And I expect the node aggregate "sir-david-nodenborough" to exist
    And I expect this node aggregate to disable dimension space points [{}]

    When I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and Dimension Space Point {}
    And VisibilityConstraints are set to "withoutRestrictions"
    Then I expect the node aggregate "lady-eleonode-rootford" to have the following child nodes:
      | Name                | NodeDiscriminator                                                                                                                 |
      | preceding-document  | {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"preceding-nodenborough", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}}  |

      | succeeding-document | {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"succeeding-nodenborough", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}} |
    And the subtree for node aggregate "lady-eleonode-rootford" with node types "" and 2 levels deep should be:
      | Level | NodeAggregateIdentifier |
      | 0     | lady-eleonode-rootford  |
      | 1     | preceding-nodenborough  |

      | 2     | nody-mc-nodeface        |
      | 1     | succeeding-nodenborough |
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "preceding-nodenborough" and path "preceding-document" to lead to node {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"preceding-nodenborough", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}}
    And I expect this node to be a child of node {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"lady-eleonode-rootford", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}}

    And I expect this node to have the succeeding siblings ["sir-david-nodenborough", "succeeding-nodenborough"]
    And I expect the node aggregate "preceding-nodenborough" to have the references:

    And I expect this node to be a child of node {"contentStreamIdentifier":"cs-identifier", "nodeAggregateIdentifier":"sir-david-nodenborough", "originDimensionSpacePoint": {}}

    When VisibilityConstraints are set to "frontend"
    Then I expect the node aggregate "lady-eleonode-rootford" to have the following child nodes:
      | Name                | NodeDiscriminator                                                                                                                 |
