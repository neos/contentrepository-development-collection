Feature: Properties

  As a user of the CR I want to be able to detect and handle properties:

  - set new default values
  - remove obsolete properties

  Background:
    Given I have no content dimensions
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document':
      properties:
        myProp:
          type: string
          defaultValue: "Foo"
    """
    And the event RootWorkspaceWasCreated was published with payload:

      | workspaceName              | "live"               |
