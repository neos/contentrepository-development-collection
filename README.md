## Requirements

### DB

The Event Sourced Content Repository relies on a feature called (Recursive) Common Table Expressions (CTE) that require
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/presentations/mysql-80-common-table-expressions/): 8.0+
* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/recursive-common-table-expressions-overview/): 10.2.2+

Lateron, we will also support [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/queries-with.html). (We know it will work, but we did not create migrations or did testing yet).

### PHP

The new code should be compatible with **PHP 7.4**

- [x] change RoutePart Handler when using event-sourced mode
- [x] adjust NodeController when using event-sourced mode
- [x] add switch to use event-sourced read model in Fusion rendering (!possibly difficult due to method signatures!)
- [x] allow to open User Interface based on Event-Sourced read model
- [x] implement Show/Hide of nodes (recursively)
- [ ] create Commands in response to UI interaction
  - [x] SetProperty command
  - [x] CreateNode
  - [x] MoveNode
  - [x] ShowNode
  - [x] DisableNode
- [x] create feature list in this README, detailing what is supported and what not yet.
- [x] support empty content dimension values in URL; e.g. "/de/..." for german, and "/..." for english
- [x] absolute node referencing for ContentCollection (e.g. shared footer in Demo Site)
- [ ] fix Policy handling to configure permissions for various UI parts
- [x] fix structure tree
- [ ] show correct workspace state after reload (top publish button)
- [?] fix inline linking
- [x] fix node tree search
- [?] fix node tree filter
- [ ] Implement Node Repair
- [ ] (further TODOs here; this list is not complete yet)

# Technical Description (for developers)

This section should give an overview about the different involved packages, to ease understanding the different moving parts.


## Neos.ContentRepository

see https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/2202 for the Pull Request.

- in namespace `Domain\Projection\Content`, the new `NodeInterface` and `TraversableNodeInterface` are defined.
- in namespace `Domain\ValueObject`, corresponding value objects are defined.
- the old `Neos\ContentRepository\Domain\Model\Node` implements the full new `NodeInterface` and most of `TraversableNodeInterface`.
  This is needed to ensure we can build FlowQuery implementations which can work with old and new API at once.
- adjusted FlowQuery operations to `TraversableNodeInterface` (TODO not yet all of them)


## Neos.Neos

see https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/2202 for the Pull Request.

- various detail improvements to use `TraversableNodeInterface` in the core (e.g. FusionView)


## Neos.ContentRepository.DimensionSpace

APIs to query the configured dimension space


## CR / Neos.EventSourcedContentRepository

Transition package implementing the event sourced CR core. In the longer run, will probably be merged into Neos.ContentRepository.

- `Domain\Context\*` implements Commands, Command Handlers, Events for Workspace, Content Stream, Nodes
- `Domain\Projection\*` implements projections for changes, workspace listing; and contains the definition for the main `Content` Graph projection (`ContentGraphInterface` and `ContentSubgraphInterface`)

## CR / Neos.ContentGraph.DoctrineDbalAdapter

implementation of the `ContentGraphInterface` and `ContentSubgraphInterface` using MySQL queries.


## CR / Neos.EventSourcedNeosAdjustments

It turns out that there are numerous changes needed to the details of Neos.Neos - so this package hooks into
various places in the Neos lifecycle to override certain Neos functionality.

We often completely override certain classes / behaviors from the Neos core completely; so that should make merging the
changes back to the Neos.Neos package at some point a lot easier because we can then replace full classes instead of
only individual pieces.

This package consists of the following bounded contexts, listed in their order during request processing:


### NodeImportFromLegacyCR

This contains a CommandController and a service to generate events from reading `NodeData`. It can be activated using
the new CLI command.


### EventSourcedRouting

We replace the default `FrontendNodeRoutePartHandler` by providing an extra implementation of `FrontendNodeRoutePartHandlerInterface`.

**Activation**: We replace the implementation of `FrontendNodeRoutePartHandlerInterface` in `Objects.yaml`.

- internally, the `Http` and `Routing` namespaces are used for behaviours internal to the routing.


### EventSourcedFrontController

This is a replacement for `Frontend\NodeController` of Neos.Neos.

**Activation**: We trigger this controller by AOP (in `NodeControllerAspect`): We call the new controller when `processRequest()` is called for the Neos controller.


### Fusion

- We replace certain Fusion implementations which are already re-implemented to work more efficiently with the ContentGraph
  API; and which implement linking (because this API also changed). This includes:
  - `Menu / DimensionMenu`
  - `NodeUri, ConvertUris`
  - `ContentElementEditable / ContentElementWrapping` (because the ContentElementWrapping service has changed quite a lot)
  - **Activation**: using fusion `autoInclude` in `Settings.yaml`, we load the Fusion file `resource://Neos.EventSourcedNeosAdjustments/Private/Fusion/Root.fusion`.
    This `Root.fusion` *replaces the implementations* for the aforementioned Fusion objects, so things work as expected for integrators (without new namespaces).

- Eel `NodeHelper` and `WorkspaceHelper`
  - **Activation**: These helpers are registered under the names `Neos.EventSourcedNeosAdjustments.*`; so a separate name.
    These helpers are explicitely used in the `Root.fusion` mentioned a few lines above.

- custom `ExceptionHandler` because this also needs the replacement `ContentElementWrappingService`.
  - **Activation**: This helper is used as exception handlers in the `Root.fusion` mentioned a few lines above.
  - If people used these exception handlers themselves, they need to reconfigure them to the new implementations.


### Fluid

- We replace Linking and Content Element Wrapping ViewHelpers, because Node Linking has changed and ContentElementWrapping
  has changed as well.
  - **Activation**: Using AOP, the `ViewHelperReplacementAspect` implements aliasing of ViewHelper classes;
    effectively returning the VHs in this namespace instead of the default ones.


### ContentElementWrapping

We implement a completely new `ContentElementWrappingService` and `ContentElementWrappingService`; mainly because
they change quite a bit and their interfaces now require `TraversableNodeInterface` instead of the legacy `NodeInterface`.

The new services are used in the overridden ViewHelpers (see section *Fluid* above); and in overridden Fusion implementations
(see section *Fusion* above).


### NodeAddress (Domain\Context\Content)

A `NodeAddress` is an external representation of a node (used in routing). TODO: Move to Neos.EventSourcedContentRepository.


### Ui

- `BackendController` is an alternative implementation for `Neos.Neos.Ui` `BackendController`.
  - **Activation**: We trigger this controller by AOP (in `BackendControllerAspect`): We call the new controller when `processRequest()` is called for the Neos backend controller.
- We create Content Streams on backend login using the `EditorContentStreamZookeeper` (TODO change name maybe?).
  - **Activation**: We trigger this service by Signal/Slot in `Package.php`.
- `Fusion` (for backend)
  - **Activation**: We load a custom `resource://Neos.EventSourcedNeosAdjustments/Private/Fusion/Backend/Root.fusion` using `Views.yaml`.
  - custom `NodeInfoHelper`, calling to a custom `NodePropertyConverterService`
- adjust the *DimensionSwitcher* JS component in `Resources/Private/UiAdapter`
- TODO: this is not everything yet.
