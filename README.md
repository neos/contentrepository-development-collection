## Requirements

### DB

The Event Sourced Content Repository relies on a feature called (Recursive) Common Table Expressions (CTE) that require
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/presentations/mysql-80-common-table-expressions/): 8.0+
* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/recursive-common-table-expressions-overview/): 10.2.2+

Lateron, we will also support [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/queries-with.html). (We know it will work, but we did not create migrations or did testing yet).

### PHP

The new code should be compatible with **PHP 7.2**

## Getting Started / Installation

1. Get started by cloning the master branch of the [neos-development-distribution](https://github.com/neos/neos-development-distribution/).
Assuming you want to install to a directory named `neos-es`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neos/neos-development-distribution.git neos-es
cd neos-es
composer install
```
**NOTE**: PHP7.2 is recommmend

2. Install Neos as usual, via the browser or manually:
   - define a database in `Configuration/Settings.yaml`
   - run `./flow doctrine:migrate`
   - import the demo site using `./flow site:import --package-key=Neos.Demo`
   - create a backend user using `./flow user:create --roles Administrator admin password My Admin`
   - ensure that when running `./flow server:run`, you get frontend output; and you can log into the backend.

### In order to get the necessary code base you need to do a few things:

1. Add `neos/contentrepository-development-collection` and `neos/content-repository-dimensionspace` dependencies ` as custom repositories`
```
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/neos/contentrepository-development-collection.git"
    },
    {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/neos/content-repository-dimensionspace.git"
    }
]
```
2. Set `minimum-stability` to `dev`
```
"minimum-stability": "dev"
```
3. Set `prefer-stable` as `true`
```
"prefer-stable": true
```
4. use the `require` part ot the composer.json file below:

> **WARNING**: The `neos/event-sourcing` dependency does not work with the current master right now and is locked to a specific commit. As soon as the master branch will be working again, we will change the dependency back to `dev-master`.

The resulting `composer.json` file should look something like this:
```yaml
{
    "config": {
        "vendor-dir": "Packages/Libraries",
        "bin-dir": "bin"
    },
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "prefer-stable": true,
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "git",
            "url": "https://github.com/neos/contentrepository-development-collection.git"
        },
        {
            "type": "git",
            "url": "https://github.com/neos/content-repository-dimensionspace.git"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "neos/neos-development-collection": "4.3.x-dev",
        "neos/flow-development-collection": "5.3.x-dev",
        "neos/demo": "@dev",

        "neos/contentrepository-development-collection": "dev-master",
        "neos/content-repository-dimensionspace": "dev-master",
        "neos/event-sourcing": "dev-master#7a39c4e5cfbf273a7d84a25a4eebd7b3874f5324",
        "neos/neos-ui": "dev-event-sourced-patch as dev-master",
        "neos/neos-ui-compiled": "@dev",

        "neos/party": "@dev",
        "neos/seo": "@dev",
        "neos/imagine": "@dev",
        "neos/twitter-bootstrap": "@dev",
        "neos/form": "@dev",
        "neos/setup": "@dev",
        "flowpack/neos-frontendlogin": "@dev",
        "neos/buildessentials": "@dev",
        "mikey179/vfsstream": "~1.6",
        "phpunit/phpunit": "~7.1.0",
        "symfony/css-selector": "~2.0",
        "neos/behat": "~5.0.0"
    },
    "scripts": {
        "post-update-cmd": "Neos\\Flow\\Composer\\InstallerScripts::postUpdateAndInstall",
        "post-install-cmd": "Neos\\Flow\\Composer\\InstallerScripts::postUpdateAndInstall",
        "post-package-update": "Neos\\Flow\\Composer\\InstallerScripts::postPackageUpdateAndInstall",
        "post-package-install": "Neos\\Flow\\Composer\\InstallerScripts::postPackageUpdateAndInstall"
    }
}
```
5. Then, run `composer update`.

6. After that, run `./flow flow:package:rescan`.

**HINT**: If you experice issues clear the `Data/Temporary` directory and run the command again.

7. If using dimensions, the dimension configuration has changed. Use the following configuration in `Settings.yaml` for the Demo site (Adjust as needed):

```yaml
Neos:
  EventSourcedContentRepository:
    contentDimensions:
      language:
        label: 'Neos.Demo:Main:contentDimensions.language'
        icon: icon-language
        defaultValue: en_US
        resolution:
          mode: 'uriPathSegment'
        values:
          en_US:
            label: 'English (US)'
            resolution:
              value: en
            specializations:
              en_UK:
                label: 'English (UK)'
                resolution:
                  value: uk
          de:
            label: German
            resolution:
              value: de
            specializations:
              nl:
                label: Dutch
                resolution:
                  value: nl
          fr:
            label: French
            resolution:
              value: fr
          da:
            label: Danish
            resolution:
              value: da
          lv:
            label: Latvian
            resolution:
              value: lv
```

8. create necessary tables using `./flow doctrine:migrate`

9. create events from your (legacy) NodeData by running `./flow contentrepositorymigrate:run` - this also populates the projection.

   NOTE: The output of this command is still a little weird; showing lots of var_dumps. When this command does
         not show a fatal error, it ran through successfully.

10. Do a manual UI rebuild due to https://github.com/neos/neos-ui/pull/2178 currently needed:

```
cd Packages/Application/Neos.Neos.Ui
make setup
```

11. Enable FrontendDevelopmentMode in `Settings.yaml`:

```yaml
Neos:
  Neos:
    Ui:
      frontendDevelopmentMode: true
```

12. The frontend should now work as expected. Test that the frontend rendering works.

13. After logging into the backend, you might still see a fatal error. In that case manually remove the URL query parameters so that the URL is only `/neos/content`

14. In case you want to start with clean events and a clean projection (after you did some changes), re-run `./flow contentrepositorymigrate:run`

15. To set up Behavioral tests, do the following:

    - install Behat: `composer require --dev --prefer-source --no-interaction neos/behat ~5.0.0`
    - clear the cache: `rm -Rf Data/Temporary; rm -Rf Build/Behat`
    - set up behat: `./flow behat:setup`
    - Create a new database for behat
    - create `Configuration/Testing/Behat/Settings.yaml` with the following contents:

        ```yaml
        Neos:
          Flow:
            persistence:
              backendOptions:
                driver: pdo_mysql
                dbname: 'YOUR-DB-NAME-HERE'
                user: 'root'
                password: ''
        ```

        Important: the driver must be set to pdo_mysql; and the DB name and user need to be specified.

16. To run the behavioral tests, do:

    ```bash
    bin/behat -c Packages/CR/Neos.EventSourcedContentRepository/Tests/Behavior/behat.yml.dist
    ```

# Technical Description (for developers)

This section should give an overview about the different involved packages, to ease understanding the different moving parts.


## Neos.ContentRepository

see https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/2202 for the Pull Request.

- in namespace `Domain\Projection\Content`, the new `NodeInterface` and `TraversableNodeInterface` are defined.
- in namespace `Domain\ValueObject`, corresponding value objects are defined.
- the old `Neos\ContentRepository\Domain\Model\Node` implements the full new `NodeInterface` and most of `TraversableNodeInterface`.
  This is needed to ensure we can build FlowQuery implementations which can work with old and new API at once.
- adjusted FlowQuery operations to `TraversableNodeInterface` (TODO not yet all of them)


## Neos.Neos

see https://github.com/neos/neos-development-collection/pull/2202 for the Pull Request.

- various detail improvements to use `TraversableNodeInterface` in the core (e.g. FusionView)


## Neos.ContentRepository.DimensionSpace

APIs to query the configured dimension space


## CR / Neos.EventSourcedContentRepository

Transition package implementing the event sourced CR core. In the longer run, will probably be merged into Neos.ContentRepository.

- `Domain\Context\*` implements Commands, Command Handlers, Events for Workspace, Content Stream, Nodes
- `Domain\Projection\*` implements projections for changes, workspace listing; and contains the definition for the main `Content` Graph projection (`ContentGraphInterface` and `ContentSubgraphInterface`)

## CR / Neos.ContentGraph.DoctrineDbalAdapter

implementation of the `ContentGraphInterface` and `ContentSubgraphInterface` using MySQL queries.


## CR / Neos.EventSourcedNeosAdjustments

It turns out that there are numerous changes needed to the details of Neos.Neos - so this package hooks into
various places in the Neos lifecycle to override certain Neos functionality.

We often completely override certain classes / behaviors from the Neos core completely; so that should make merging the
changes back to the Neos.Neos package at some point a lot easier because we can then replace full classes instead of
only individual pieces.

This package consists of the following bounded contexts, listed in their order during request processing:


### NodeImportFromLegacyCR

This contains a CommandController and a service to generate events from reading `NodeData`. It can be activated using
the new CLI command.


### EventSourcedRouting

We replace the default `FrontendNodeRoutePartHandler` by providing an extra implementation of `FrontendNodeRoutePartHandlerInterface`.

**Activation**: We replace the implementation of `FrontendNodeRoutePartHandlerInterface` in `Objects.yaml`.

- internally, the `Http` and `Routing` namespaces are used for behaviours internal to the routing.


### EventSourcedFrontController

This is a replacement for `Frontend\NodeController` of Neos.Neos.

**Activation**: We trigger this controller by AOP (in `NodeControllerAspect`): We call the new controller when `processRequest()` is called for the Neos controller.


### Fusion

- We replace certain Fusion implementations which are already re-implemented to work more efficiently with the ContentGraph
  API; and which implement linking (because this API also changed). This includes:
  - `Menu / DimensionMenu`
  - `NodeUri, ConvertUris`
  - `ContentElementEditable / ContentElementWrapping` (because the ContentElementWrapping service has changed quite a lot)
  - **Activation**: using fusion `autoInclude` in `Settings.yaml`, we load the Fusion file `resource://Neos.EventSourcedNeosAdjustments/Private/Fusion/Root.fusion`.
    This `Root.fusion` *replaces the implementations* for the aforementioned Fusion objects, so things work as expected for integrators (without new namespaces).

- Eel `NodeHelper` and `WorkspaceHelper`
  - **Activation**: These helpers are registered under the names `Neos.EventSourcedNeosAdjustments.*`; so a separate name.
    These helpers are explicitely used in the `Root.fusion` mentioned a few lines above.

- custom `ExceptionHandler` because this also needs the replacement `ContentElementWrappingService`.
  - **Activation**: This helper is used as exception handlers in the `Root.fusion` mentioned a few lines above.
  - If people used these exception handlers themselves, they need to reconfigure them to the new implementations.


### Fluid

- We replace Linking and Content Element Wrapping ViewHelpers, because Node Linking has changed and ContentElementWrapping
  has changed as well.
  - **Activation**: Using AOP, the `ViewHelperReplacementAspect` implements aliasing of ViewHelper classes;
    effectively returning the VHs in this namespace instead of the default ones.


### ContentElementWrapping

We implement a completely new `ContentElementWrappingService` and `ContentElementWrappingService`; mainly because
they change quite a bit and their interfaces now require `TraversableNodeInterface` instead of the legacy `NodeInterface`.

The new services are used in the overridden ViewHelpers (see section *Fluid* above); and in overridden Fusion implementations
(see section *Fusion* above).


### NodeAddress (Domain\Context\Content)

A `NodeAddress` is an external representation of a node (used in routing). TODO: Move to Neos.EventSourcedContentRepository.


### Ui

- `BackendController` is an alternative implementation for `Neos.Neos.Ui` `BackendController`.
  - **Activation**: We trigger this controller by AOP (in `BackendControllerAspect`): We call the new controller when `processRequest()` is called for the Neos backend controller.
- We create Content Streams on backend login using the `EditorContentStreamZookeeper` (TODO change name maybe?).
  - **Activation**: We trigger this service by Signal/Slot in `Package.php`.
- `Fusion` (for backend)
  - **Activation**: We load a custom `resource://Neos.EventSourcedNeosAdjustments/Private/Fusion/Backend/Root.fusion` using `Views.yaml`.
  - custom `NodeInfoHelper`, calling to a custom `NodePropertyConverterService`
- adjust the *DimensionSwitcher* JS component in `Resources/Private/UiAdapter`
- TODO: this is not everything yet.
